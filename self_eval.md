# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel about your use of built-in Ruby methods?

**Answer: fairly confident**

- How confident do you feel writing simple methods of your own?

**Answer: still need more work, but not expecting to be an expert already so I'm happy with the progress I'm making!**

- What questions do you have about methods, and what they are capable of? (ask a question!!!)

**Answer: can you define a second method within a method you're defining and still have the method work?**
